# My_weekly_schdule

What i did in this challenge was to be able to display the time format at the top of the planner. Also be able to change the planner to display current hour and be able to save whatever i input in the text area to local storage.

First step was to add the missing timeblocks which was adding from 12pm to 5pm. 

Next step i took was to format the date with Day.js to have it formatted as Day, # of the month and year.

After that i needed to create a function to set the current time equal to the timeblocks so the hours would change and have the correct color to associated with the past present and future.

After that i needed to create and set values for local storage to be able to save things and have them showen when refreshing the page.
